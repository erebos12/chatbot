* (optional) explain framework
* http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
Create stand-alone Spring applications
Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

## REST
* representational state transfer
* sits on top of HTTP standard and uses all the methods provided to define scalable and resuable web services
* REST works with the concept of resources and actions on theose resources
* e.g. a resource could be a course like the coding adademy
